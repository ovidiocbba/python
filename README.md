## Section 1: Introduction to Python
### How a Python Program Runs?
**1. Python Interpreter Reads the Code (.py file)**

- The Python `interpreter` starts by **reading the source code**.

**2. Compiling to Bytecode (.pyc file in __pycache__)**

- The `interpreter` **compiles** the code into **bytecode**, an intermediate representation for efficiency.

**3. Executing in the Python Virtual Machine (PVM)**
- The `interpreter` **runs the bytecode**using the Python Virtual Machine (PVM), which processes instructions line by line.

**4. Interacting with the Operating System**
- The interpreter communicates with the OS to manage files, databases, networking, and I/O operations.
